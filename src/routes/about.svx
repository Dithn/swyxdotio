## TL;DR

Hey, I'm swyx! I help build great developer experiences, from documentation to dev tools to dev communities, most recently as [Head of DX at Temporal.io](https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/), based out of Seattle.
I am also a frequent writer and speaker best known for the [Learn in Public](https://swyx.io/LIP) movement and recently published [The Coding Career Handbook](https://learninpublic.org) with more advice for engineers going from Junior to Senior.

P.S. "swyx" is the initials of my English and Chinese names and you can use it interchangeably with "Shawn". It is pronounced "swicks".

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swyx), [Github](https://github.com/sw-yx) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/swyxTV)!

## About

I am a [GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ](https://stars.github.com/), [Stripe Community Expert](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1392016498944741376), helped run [the React subreddit for over 200,000 developers](https://www.swyx.io/moderating-rreactjs/) and grew [Svelte Society from 0 to over 15,000 developers](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1411071913548414976) ([writeup](https://www.swyx.io/starting-dev-community-meetup)).

I grew up in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, but have worked mostly in the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ , most recently remotely out of Miami, Florida, working on Developer Experience for [Netlify](https://www.swyx.io/writing/farewell-netlify/), [Amazon Web Services](https://www.swyx.io/writing/hello-aws/), [Temporal](https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/), and Airbyte (unannounced).
