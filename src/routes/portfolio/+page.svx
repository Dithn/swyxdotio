## Advising and Investing Portfolio

My largest shareholdings are Temporal and Netlify, but for the last 5ish years I have been advising and investing in startups, having started the [devtools-angels community](https://dx.tips/angel-101).
                                                                                                                       
I mostly help startups do a few things:
  - figure out their devrel & dev community strategy
  - hire their first few devrels
  - give AI product feedback and launch guidance.

My portcos do not get any guaranteed spots in either Latent Space or AI Engineer, however of course familiarity with them and their progress can cause their odds of being featured to go up. However if they're not a fit, orders of magnitude more of my self worth and identity and principles and value is in LS and AIE and I will not "sell out" just to "pump my bags".
